        This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Feedpresso at

        <li> The materials on Feedpresso's website, service or mobile apps are provided on an 'as is' basis. Feedpresso makes
            no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without
            limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement

    <p>

        website, service or mobile apps, even if Feedpresso or a Feedpresso authorized representative has been notified orally
        or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties,
